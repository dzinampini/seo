### Domain Age 
how long a domain name has been in existence? (Existence as in for how long has it been indexed.) Search engines have a tendency of ignoring new domain names simply because they are new. 
As long as your site has been around for longer than those first few months when domain age is a big factor, you should be able to swing with the oldest of them and claw your way to the top of your Google rankings. 
Check creation and expiry date

### Reverse IP
Search engines like clean and static IP
Checks up number of websites on the same system
designed for those website owners who are using shared hosting services. The tool displays all other websites that share your IP address and checks for any malicious content on them.
if the IP you are using is also used for a web site with malicious content, then that means your site will also have poor ranking 

### Canonicalisation 
A canonical tag (aka "rel canonical") is a way of telling search engines that a specific URL represents the master copy of a page. Using the canonical tag prevents problems caused by identical or "duplicate" content appearing on multiple URLs. Practically speaking, the canonical tag tells search engines which version of a URL you want to appear in search results.

well you need to find out more especially for classifieds and blog sites 

<link rel=”canonical” href=”http://www.dzinaishempini.com/about.html”>


### Index your site on google

### HTML Sitemap 
An HTML sitemap allows site visitors to easily navigate a website. It is a bulleted outline text version of the site navigation. The anchor text displayed in the outline is linked to the page it references. Site visitors can go to the Sitemap to locate a topic they are unable to find by searching the site or navigating through the site menus.

HTML is just a general overview of the site, just the pages and info a user needs to be concerned with. If you’re on a web site and you’re looking for the shopping cart or the ‘Contact Us’ page and can’t find it, you’d go to the sitemap and easily find it there. While this is geared towards the user, it can also help your search engine ranking because your site is user-friendly and catering to the site visitor.

### XML Sitemap
1.  Go to a sitemap generator
2.  Download the sitemap file and upload it into the domain root folder of your site 
3.  Check that sitemap is showing for you at http://erpminsights.com/sitemap.xml
4.  go to your Google Webmaster account and add your sitemap URL.
A XML sitemap protocol is specifically intended for search engine spiders. At its root, XML is a file that includes all the behind the scenes activity on a web site. Not just the site’s main URL, but all the URLs within the site along with the associated metadata. This can include when the URL was last updated, how important it is, the average frequency changes occur, the URLs relation to the rest of the site, etc

### Google Sitemap 

### Breadcrumb
Good for site visitors to see where they are within your site. \

### Customised 404 error within your site 
Add this to the .htaccess file: 
ErrorDocument 404 http://www.domain.com/404page.html 
That's it. Just that line. (Yes, it should all be on one line--some smaller computer screens may bump it down to two--get it all on one.) Where I have http://www.domain.com/404page.html is where you place the full URL pointing to that new, fancy 404 Error page you've created.
...you have already created an error page, right? 

Upload your new 404 error page, if you haven't already, and log into your site. Then try to go to a page that doesn't exist
