or if your site has been on watch for a long time, drill down into your website's traffic sources, and sift through you organic search traffic bucket to identify the keywords people are using to arrive at your site.

### When you find these you can add them to your 
1. Meta Description  and meta keywords 
Google doesn’t use the meta description tag as a direct ranking signal. The meta description tells google and people what your page is about. 
However, your description tag can impact click-through-rate, which is a key ranking factor.
Ideally, your description should be no longer than 155 characters or 2 lines are good (including spaces). However, check the search engine results page (SERP) of choice to confirm this. Some are longer and some are shorter. This is only a rule of thumb, not a definite “best practice” anymore.

2. Page titles 
3. Urls
4. H1 content 
H1 tags are a “second title tag”. Along with your title tag, Google uses your H1 tag as a secondary relevancy signal, according to results from one correlation study:
5. Body content 
6. Site navigation link text 
7. Image Alt Tag and image name text 


#### Never use the meta keyword tag
-no longer needed, though it used to be important 
-considered as spam now 

### Negative keywords 
use “negative keywords” to prevent your ads from appearing when people search for things that aren’t relevant to your business. For example, [-pencil], [-pastel] and [-horse].

These negative keywords will block your ads any time a search contains one or all of them.


### Latent Semantic Indexing Keywords in Content (LSI):  
LSI keywords help search engines extract meaning from words that have more than one meaning (for example: Apple the computer company vs. Apple the fruit). The presence/absence of LSI probably also acts as a content quality signal.
