#### A word on the keywords meta tag 
A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away, the “keywords” meta tag was a critical element for early search engines. Much like the dinosaurs, this tag is a fossil from ancient search engine times.

The only search engine that looks at the keywords anymore is Microsoft’s Bing – and they use it to help detect spam. To avoid hurting your site, your best option is to never add this tag.

Or, if that’s too radical for you to stomach, at least make sure you haven’t stuffed 300 keywords in the hopes of higher search rankings. It won’t work. Sorry.

If you already have keyword meta tags on your website, but they aren’t spammy, there’s no reason to spend the next week hurriedly taking them out. It’s OK to leave them for now – just take them out as you’re able, to reduce page weight and load times.

#### rather make use of the meta description keyword
Ideally, your description should be no longer than 155 characters (including spaces). However, check the search engine results page (SERP) of choice to confirm this. Some are longer and some are shorter. This is only a rule of thumb, not a definite “best practice” anymore.



#### Use the different keywords in different areas eg 
Page Title: Birmingham Accountants
H1 Tag: Birmingham Chartered Accountancy Firm
Body Content: If you need a chartered accountant in Birmingham…
Image Tag: – John-Birmingham-Accountant
Meta Description: We are one of the best accountants in Birmingham…
